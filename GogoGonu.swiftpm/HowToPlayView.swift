        In this app, you can play the representative Gonu games, 'Woomul(well) Gonu' and 'Hobak(pumpkin) Gonu'. The common rules of both Gonu are as follows.
                             
        1. Two people play the game.
        2. Move a piece alternately with your opponent.
        3. You can only move your piece one space at a time.
        4. You win if you make your opponent's pieces unable to move anywhere.
        
        In Hobak Gonu, a rule is added that a piece that leaves the base cannot re-enter it, nor can it enter the opponent's base.
        
        You can enjoy the game whether you are alone or with your friends. Choose single mode if you're alone, or multi mode if you have someone to play with.
